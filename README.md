# Exercise-tracker
A simple exercise tracking software made using MERN stack.

For new people, MERN stack is a technology stack made of (M)ongo, (E)xpress, (R)eact, (N)odeJS.
This exercise tracker is made using NodeJS and Express for backend while React for frontend. For database, I will use Mongo initially but I will also make another code for using MySQL. This way, I can cover both SQL and NoSQL databases. I will also provide links to the resources I will use in this project. This project may initially be similar to many other projects and tutorials, but over time, I also plan to add newer technologies such as tokenization for authorization etc.
